# Pomodoro Timer built in Ruby
Simple goal, just make a Pomodoro timer using ruby. Basic terminal program at the moment, looking to expand.

Version numbers are gibberish for the most part but they feel important. Set up a SQLite DB instead. Seemed more appropriate to what I wanted to do vs json (or csv). Both of the former could work easily but this also gives me the ability to practice sql which is something I haven't done in a long time. Still working on the sql and inputs. currently busted. 

### Pipedream ideas/soon to come
* integrate with music app to trigger a stop at breaks
* eod button that plays the congratulation clip from neon genesis evangelion as a fun little eod bit.
* glimmer

So some good news, I have it working. Currently it auto starts break on end of Pomodoro. I would like to add some user inputs here. Simple (y/n) is what I would like to do. Had to borrow a gist for the time display function. There's a better option that I will be switching too but at the moment this one makes sense and I can read and understand how it works.
