# Pomodoro Timer built in Ruby
Simple goal, just make a Pomodoro timer using ruby. Basic terminal program at the moment, looking to expand.

## 5/4/24 v0.02
So some good news, I have it working. Currently it auto starts break on end of Pomodoro. I would like to add some user inputs here. Simple (y/n) is what I would like to do. Had to borrow a gist for the time display function. There's a better option that I will be switching too but at the moment this one makes sense and I can read and understand how it works.
